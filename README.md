# WP-connect 

Summary 
-------
This code runs as a secondary admin panel along side wordpress. It uses /wp-connect/ instead of /wp-admin/. This was primarily built to work as a "client portal" for Merchant rewards giant,  [Get Merchant Rewards.](https://www.getmerchantrewards.com/) Note that this is just sample, and does not include critical parts of the code and is also only **BETA.**

I think you know how to install if you're so eager ;)
